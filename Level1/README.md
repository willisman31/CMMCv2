# Level 1
## About
Laid out below are the requirements for complying with level 1 of version 2 of the cybersecurity maturity model certification.  These requirements are based on [FAR clause 52-204.21](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.204-21), which dictates the basic safeguarding of covered contractor information systems. Covered contractor information systems are those which store, process, or transmit federal contract information (FCI).  
FCI is information which is provided as part of a government contract for procurement of some service or product and is not publicly available.  In other words, all the data that is created when a federal contract is being executed is considered FCI unless that data is already public.  FCI can include proprietary business processes, plans and specifications, or any other information that is consumed as part of the execution of a federal contract. Fortunately, FCI requires only basic protections which are typically satisfied by the default security settings of your information system.
The requirements for fulfilling level 1 of the CMMCv2 are very basic, all contractors who handle FCI must complete an annual self-assessment of their security posture and follow 17 simple practices for security which are listed [here]() along with explanations and how they can be easily accomplished.
