# CMMCv2
## Meta
This repository is meant to be a one-stop-shop for all CMMCv2-related questions; it will lay out the requirements set by each of the 3 levels of the version 2 regulation, different ways in which compliance can be achieved in common environments, and it will offer insight into best practices, timelines, and expectations for business.
## What is CMMC?
CMMCv2 is the latest iteration of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, it is a regulation created by the DoD to govern the minimum cybersecurity posture acceptable by active members of the Defense Industrial Base (DIB).  It contains 3 levels of compliance which correspond to the level of security required by different kinds of information handled by the DIB; level 1 is for Federal Contract Information (FCI) and is required for every single organization doing business with the Department of Defense.  Level 2 is for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI or "cooey") which is refers to unclassified information which could still be harmful if released indiscriminately; level 2 mandates the protections layed out in NIST SP 800-171 as well as those inherited from level 1.  There is some nuance to how the security requirements for levels 2 and 3 which will be explained later.  Last, is level 3 which is reserved for secret or top secret information which adds to NISPOM requirements for protection of classified information.  Level 3 inherits the protections mandated by level 2 and adds to them some of the items from NIST SP 800-172.  All of these requirements are explained in more detail in their respective folders.
